# The #1 Mistake Expats Make

Hey{{#if name}} {{name}}{{/if}},

The biggest mistake I see people make when moving to Latin America?

**Booking long-term housing before they arrive.**

They find a "great deal" on Airbnb, lock in 3 months, and then realize:
- The neighborhood is sketchy at night
- The WiFi can't handle video calls
- There's a rooster next door that starts at 4am
- The "walkable to everything" is actually a 30-minute Uber

I've done this. It cost me $2,000 in a non-refundable booking for an apartment I left after a week.

**What to do instead:**

1. Book 1-2 weeks in a central Airbnb
2. Spend that time walking neighborhoods at different times of day
3. Check the WiFi at local coffee shops
4. Ask other expats where they live
5. THEN sign a longer-term lease

The good news: Long-term rentals are usually 30-50% cheaper than Airbnb anyway. And you'll actually like where you end up.

Tomorrow: I'll share my neighborhood rankings for each city.
