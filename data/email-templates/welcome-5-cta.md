# Ready to Get Serious?

Hey{{#if name}} {{name}}{{/if}},

By now you've got a sense of what moving to Latin America actually involves.

If you're serious about making it happen, here's how I can help:

**Strategy Call - $150 / 30 minutes**

We'll cover:
- Your specific situation (finances, work, timeline)
- Which country/city makes sense for you
- Visa strategy for your nationality
- Neighborhood recommendations
- Banking and money setup
- The stuff nobody talks about

I've done this move. I've made the mistakes. I can save you months of trial and error.

No worries. Keep exploring the blog, check out the guides, and reply to these emails anytime with questions.

I'm not going anywhere.

P.S. If $150 feels like a lot, consider this: One bad apartment costs more than that. One visa mistake costs way more. The call pays for itself in avoided errors.
