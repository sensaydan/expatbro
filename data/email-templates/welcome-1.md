# Welcome to Expat Bro

Hey{{#if name}} {{name}}{{/if}},

Thanks for checking out Expat Bro. I'm Dan — I've been living the nomad life for 6+ years, visited 110 countries, and every single country in the Americas.

I'm not here to sell you a dream. I'm here to tell you what actually works.

Over the next couple weeks, I'll share:
- The real cost of living (not the "$1000/month paradise" nonsense)
- Which neighborhoods are actually worth living in
- Visa strategies that work
- Safety — honest assessments, not paranoia
- How to actually build a life, not just "travel"

**One thing to do right now:**

If you haven't already, grab the free [Expat Bro Starter Kit](https://expatbro.co/guides). It's a quick-reference guide covering the basics for Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil.

Talk soon,

Dan
