# Is Mexico City Safe? An Honest 2026 Assessment

"But isn't Mexico dangerous?"

I've heard this question from every single person back home. And I get it—the news makes it sound like a war zone. But the reality of living in Mexico City is very different from the headlines.

Let me give you an honest assessment based on years of living here.

## The Short Answer

Mexico City is about as safe as any major world capital—comparable to cities like New York, London, or Los Angeles. In the neighborhoods where expats live (Roma, Condesa, Polanco, Coyoacán), violent crime against foreigners is rare.

That said, it's not Disneyland. Petty crime exists. Common sense matters. Let's break it down.

## What the Statistics Say

According to 2025 crime data:

- **Homicide rate in CDMX**: Lower than many US cities (Chicago, Baltimore, New Orleans)
- **Most crime is property-related**: Pickpocketing, phone theft, car break-ins
- **Tourist areas are heavily policed**: Roma, Condesa, Polanco, Centro
- **Cartel violence is near zero in CDMX**: The cartels operate elsewhere

The vast majority of violence in Mexico happens in specific border states and conflict zones—not in the capital.

## Real Crimes That Actually Happen

Let's talk about what you genuinely need to watch out for:

### Phone Snatching
The most common crime affecting expats. Typically happens:
- While you're looking at your phone on the street
- On public transit (especially crowded Metro)
- At outdoor cafe tables

**Prevention**: Keep your phone out of sight when walking. Use a crossbody bag. Don't leave your phone on restaurant tables.

### Pickpocketing
Classic Metro crime. Crowded trains during rush hour are prime territory.

**Prevention**: Use front pockets. Keep bags in front of you. Avoid rush hour if possible.

### Taxi Scams
Unregistered taxis can be risky—both for scams and safety.

**Prevention**: Use only Uber, DiDi, or registered Sitio taxis. Never hail random cabs off the street.

### Express Kidnapping
This is the scary one that gets attention. Victims are forced to withdraw cash from ATMs. It's rare but real.

**Prevention**: Don't use street ATMs at night. Use Uber instead of street taxis. Avoid stumbling around drunk alone.

### Apartment Break-ins
Happens occasionally, especially ground-floor units without security.

**Prevention**: Choose buildings with 24/7 security, cameras, and good locks. Avoid ground floor if possible.

## Neighborhoods: The Real Safety Map

### Very Safe (Expat Standards)
- **Polanco**: Most upscale, very low crime
- **Lomas de Chapultepec**: Wealthy, gated areas
- **Condesa**: Well-patrolled, expat-heavy
- **Roma Norte**: Popular, generally safe, some petty crime
- **Coyoacán**: Family-friendly, relatively quiet

### Generally Safe (With Normal Precautions)
- **Roma Sur**: Slightly less polished than Norte
- **Juárez**: Up-and-coming, improving rapidly
- **Del Valle**: Middle-class Mexican area, fine
- **Nápoles**: Business district, boring but safe

### Exercise Caution
- **Centro Histórico**: Safe during day, dicey at night in spots
- **Doctores**: Gentrifying but still rough edges
- **Zona Rosa**: Tourist area, but some sketchy late-night activity

### Avoid (As an Expat)
- **Tepito**: Famous market, famous for crime
- **Iztapalapa**: Working class, higher crime
- **Parts of the East/Northeast**: Generally rougher areas

## Day vs Night Safety

**Daytime**: Most of CDMX is perfectly safe during daylight hours. Walk around, explore, enjoy yourself.

**Evening (6-10pm)**: Still generally fine in nice areas. Restaurants, bars, social activities—all good.

**Late Night (After midnight)**: This is when you need more caution:
- Take Uber, not walking
- Stay in groups if possible
- Avoid empty streets
- Keep phone out of sight

## Women's Safety

I've asked female friends and partners about their experiences. The consensus:

**Street harassment**: Cat-calling exists but is less aggressive than some Latin American countries. Most women describe it as annoying rather than threatening.

**Physical safety**: In the expat areas, women generally feel safe walking alone during the day. At night, same precautions as anywhere—Uber, don't walk alone, stay aware.

**Dating safety**: Meet in public places first. Tell friends where you're going. Same common sense as anywhere.

**Specific to CDMX**: The Metro has women-only cars during rush hours. Many women use these.

## Public Transit Safety

### Metro
- **Rush hour**: Pickpocket central. Guard your belongings.
- **Off-peak**: Much more comfortable, lower risk
- **Late night**: Feels safe but be aware
- **Women's cars**: Available and recommended for women

### Metrobús
- Generally safer than Metro (less crowded)
- Same awareness applies

### Uber/DiDi
- Safest option overall
- Always verify the car/driver matches the app
- Share your trip with someone

### Ecobici (Bike Share)
- Great during daylight
- Dedicated bike lanes in Roma/Condesa/Reforma are safe
- I wouldn't ride late at night

## Earthquake Preparedness

This isn't crime, but it's a real safety consideration:

- CDMX is in an earthquake zone
- September 19 is historically significant (1985 and 2017 quakes)
- Know your building's exit routes
- Download the SASSLA app (early warning system)
- Keep emergency supplies at home

Modern buildings have strict codes. Older buildings in Centro are higher risk.

## What I Actually Do

Here's my personal routine after years in CDMX:

1. **Always use Uber/DiDi** (never street taxis)
2. **Keep phone in front pocket or bag** when walking
3. **Don't wear flashy jewelry** (wedding band is fine)
4. **Stay aware at night** (not paranoid, just aware)
5. **Avoid ATMs after dark** (use daytime, inside banks)
6. **Live in a building with security** (doorman, cameras)
7. **Don't carry much cash** (Apple Pay works most places)
8. **Learn basic Spanish** (helps in sketchy situations)

## What I Don't Worry About

- **Walking around Roma/Condesa during day**: Feels completely safe
- **Taking Metro during off-peak**: Fine with awareness
- **Late dinners in nice areas**: Not a concern
- **General mugging**: Rare in expat neighborhoods
- **Cartel violence**: Zero concern in CDMX

## If Something Happens

### Phone Stolen
1. Don't resist—let it go
2. Track with Find My iPhone/Google (rarely works)
3. Report to police (for insurance, not recovery)
4. Cancel SIM remotely
5. Get a new phone (cheaper here than US)

### Mugging/Assault
1. Comply—stuff is replaceable
2. Get to safety
3. Report to tourist police (more helpful than regular police)
4. Contact your embassy if needed
5. Seek support—it's traumatic

### Medical Emergency
- Dial 911 (works in Mexico)
- Or go directly to hospital (ABC, Médica Sur for expat-standard care)
- Private hospitals are excellent but expensive—have insurance

## The Reality Check

I've lived in Mexico City for years. In that time:

- I've never been mugged
- I've never witnessed violent crime
- I had one phone snatching (my fault—looking at it while walking)
- I know friends who've had minor incidents (pickpocketing, mostly)

That's living here full-time, going out regularly, exploring the city. The vast majority of expats have similar experiences—minor incidents at worst.

Compare that to living in any other major city and it's... normal.

## Final Verdict

Is Mexico City safe? Yes, with normal big-city precautions.

Is it safer than Zurich? No.
Is it more dangerous than Chicago? Also no.

It's a massive, vibrant city with all that entails. Use common sense, stick to good neighborhoods, and you'll be fine.

The people spreading fear have usually never been here. The people who live here rarely want to leave.
