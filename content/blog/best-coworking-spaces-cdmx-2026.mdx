Mexico City has become the remote work capital of Latin America. That means coworking spaces everywhere — from polished corporate towers to hipster warehouses to cafés that gave up pretending they aren't coworking spaces. Here's what's actually worth your money.

## The Top Tier

### Selina (Multiple Locations)

The hostel-coworking hybrid that's taken over the digital nomad world.

**Locations:** Roma Norte, Downtown

**Price:** Day pass ~$20 USD, Monthly ~$200-250

**The vibe:** Very much "digital nomad central." You'll meet people, probably too many people. Good for networking, bad for deep focus work. The Roma location is loud — it's attached to a hostel bar.

**Internet:** Reliable 50-100 Mbps

**Best for:** People new to the scene who want built-in social life

**Skip if:** You actually need to concentrate

### WeWork (Multiple Locations)

The standard corporate option.

**Locations:** Reforma, Polanco, Santa Fe, others

**Price:** Hot desk from $250/month, Dedicated $350+, Private offices $600+

**The vibe:** Professional, quiet, predictable. Free beer on tap (dangerous for productivity). Good for Zoom calls — proper meeting rooms and phone booths.

**Internet:** Solid 100+ Mbps

**Best for:** People with serious jobs who expense it

**Skip if:** You're bootstrapping or want anything resembling character

### Homework (Roma/Condesa)

The local Mexican chain that actually gets the balance right.

**Locations:** Roma, Condesa, Santa Fe

**Price:** Day pass $15, Monthly $180-220

**The vibe:** Design-forward spaces that feel like a nice office, not a hostel lounge. Mexican professionals mix with expats. Good coffee, good lighting, reasonable noise levels.

**Internet:** Strong and consistent

**Best for:** Serious remote workers who want quality without WeWork prices

**Skip if:** You want constant socializing

## The Budget Options

### Centraal (Roma)

The beloved budget option that feels like it should cost more.

**Price:** Monthly from $100, Day passes available

**The vibe:** Industrial-chic warehouse. High ceilings, plants, exposed brick. Gets crowded, but there's usually a spot. The café serves decent food and coffee. Rooftop terrace is nice for breaks.

**Internet:** Usually good, occasionally spotty

**Best for:** Budget-conscious workers who still want a proper space

**Skip if:** You need guaranteed quiet or reliable video calls

### Impact Hub (Roma)

Social enterprise focused coworking.

**Price:** Monthly $150-200

**The vibe:** Mix of startups, NGOs, and social entrepreneurs. More mission-driven crowd than the nomad party scene. Regular events and workshops, some interesting, some not.

**Internet:** Adequate

**Best for:** People who want community with purpose

**Skip if:** You just want to work in peace

### Public Cafés with WiFi

Let's be honest — half the remote workers in Roma are in coffee shops.

**Top picks:**
- **Café Nin (Juárez):** Great space, good coffee, tolerant of laptop workers
- **Chiquitito (Roma):** Specialty coffee, small but dedicated remote work section
- **Cardinal Casa de Café (Roma):** Bigger space, breakfast food, steady WiFi
- **Panadería Rosetta (Roma):** Good luck getting a seat, but worth it

**What you'll pay:** 80-150 pesos ($4-8) every few hours on coffee

**Unspoken rules:** Order every 2 hours or give up your seat. Don't take calls without headphones. Don't be the person who camps all day on one espresso.

## The Hidden Gems

### Bunker (Roma)

Underground space (literally) with serious work vibes.

**Price:** $120-150/month

**The vibe:** Minimal distractions. The name is accurate — it feels like a bunker. Great for heads-down work. Not much social scene.

**Best for:** Introverts and deadline mode

### Público (Condesa)

More café than coworking, but with dedicated work areas.

**Price:** Café purchases (figure $5-8/day)

**The vibe:** Beautiful space, great food, actual Mexicans mixed with foreigners. Gets social in evenings but quiet during work hours.

**Best for:** Those who want flexibility without monthly commitment

## The Nomad Scene

### Outsite (Coming and going)

Sometimes there's an Outsite coliving/coworking in CDMX, sometimes not. Check current status.

**The vibe:** Curated community of remote workers. More intense social scene — you live and work with the same people.

**Best for:** Those going all-in on the nomad lifestyle

### Selina Rooftop Sessions

Various Selina locations host "work from rooftop" days with DJs, drinks, and laptops. It's as productive as it sounds (not very), but good for meeting people.

## Neighborhood Breakdown

**Roma Norte:** Most options, most nomads, loudest

**Condesa:** Quieter, fewer dedicated spaces, more café options

**Polanco:** WeWork and corporate options, less character

**Juárez:** Emerging scene, fewer crowds

**Coyoacán:** Almost nothing dedicated — you're café hopping

## The WiFi Reality

Most coworking spaces deliver 50-100 Mbps, which is fine for everything except heavy video production or gaming.

**Pro tip:** Always have a backup. Telcel or AT&T hotspot on your phone costs $10-15/month for unlimited data. When the coworking WiFi dies (it will), you're covered.

**Video calls:** Most spaces have phone booths or private rooms, but they book up fast. Schedule important calls early or late.

## My Recommendations

**Just arrived, want to meet people:** Selina for a month, then evaluate

**Need to actually work:** Homework or Centraal

**Have corporate budget:** WeWork, it's fine

**Budget mode:** Centraal monthly + café rotation

**Maximum focus:** Get an apartment with good WiFi and work from home

The coworking shuffle is a rite of passage in CDMX. Most people try 2-3 spots before finding their rhythm. Don't commit to annual passes until you know what works for you.

And whatever you choose — invest in good headphones. The cafe con leche machines are loud everywhere.
