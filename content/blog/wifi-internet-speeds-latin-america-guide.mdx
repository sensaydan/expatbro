# Internet & WiFi in Latin America: What Remote Workers Need to Know

Nothing kills remote work productivity like bad internet. Before you book that Airbnb or sign a lease, here's what to actually expect across Latin America.

## The Reality Check

Latin American internet has improved dramatically, but it's not uniform. You can have fiber in one building and barely functional DSL next door.

**The rule**: Never trust listings. Always verify before committing.

## Country-by-Country Breakdown

### Mexico 🇲🇽

**Average speeds**: 50-200 Mbps in cities
**Reliability**: Good in major cities, variable elsewhere
**Main providers**: Telmex, Izzi, Totalplay

**Best connectivity:**
- Mexico City (Roma, Condesa, Polanco): Excellent
- Guadalajara: Very good
- Monterrey: Excellent
- Playa del Carmen: Good
- Tulum: Variable (infrastructure issues)
- Oaxaca: Okay, improving

**Watch out for:**
- Telmex has a near-monopoly, limiting options
- Newer buildings often have fiber, older ones don't
- Beach towns have less reliable infrastructure

### Colombia 🇨🇴

**Average speeds**: 50-300 Mbps in cities
**Reliability**: Generally good
**Main providers**: Claro, Movistar, ETB, Tigo

**Best connectivity:**
- Medellín: Excellent (especially El Poblado, Laureles)
- Bogotá: Very good
- Cartagena: Okay (old city is worse)
- Santa Marta: Variable

**Standout**: Colombia has invested heavily in internet infrastructure. Medellín specifically is one of the best cities in LATAM for remote work.

### Brazil 🇧🇷

**Average speeds**: 50-500 Mbps in cities
**Reliability**: Good in major cities
**Main providers**: Claro, Vivo, Tim, Oi

**Best connectivity:**
- São Paulo: Excellent
- Rio de Janeiro: Good
- Florianópolis: Very good (tech hub)
- Porto Alegre: Good

**Challenge**: Brazil is massive. Quality varies enormously by region.

### Argentina 🇦🇷

**Average speeds**: 30-100 Mbps
**Reliability**: Moderate (infrastructure aging)
**Main providers**: Fibertel, Telecentro, Movistar

**Best connectivity:**
- Buenos Aires (Palermo, Recoleta): Good
- Córdoba: Okay
- Mendoza: Variable

**Issue**: Argentina's economic situation affects infrastructure investment. Speeds are often slower than neighbors.

### Costa Rica 🇨🇷

**Average speeds**: 50-200 Mbps
**Reliability**: Good
**Main providers**: Kolbi (ICE), Tigo, Claro

**Best connectivity:**
- San José area: Good
- Escazú/Santa Ana: Excellent
- Beach towns: Variable

### Peru 🇵🇪

**Average speeds**: 30-100 Mbps
**Reliability**: Moderate
**Main providers**: Movistar, Claro, Entel

**Best connectivity:**
- Lima (Miraflores, Barranco): Good
- Cusco: Okay
- Arequipa: Improving

## How to Verify Before Booking

### Step 1: Ask for Speed Test

Request the host run a speed test at speedtest.net during working hours. Not early morning, not late night—when you'd actually be working.

**Minimum requirements for remote work:**
- Video calls: 10 Mbps up/down
- Comfortable work: 25+ Mbps
- Multiple users/heavy use: 50+ Mbps

### Step 2: Check Upload Speed

Download gets all the attention, but upload matters for:
- Video calls
- Uploading files
- Streaming yourself

Many connections have asymmetric speeds (100 down / 10 up). You need at least 5-10 Mbps upload.

### Step 3: Ask About Outages

Questions to ask:
- How often does internet go out?
- How long do outages typically last?
- Is there a backup connection?

### Step 4: Check Fiber vs DSL

Fiber = generally more reliable and faster
DSL/Cable = more variable, often slower
Mobile hotspot = backup only

Ask specifically: "Is this fiber to the building?"

## Coworking Backup Strategy

Even with good home internet, have a backup:

### Mexico City
- WeWork (multiple locations)
- Selina (Roma)
- Impact Hub
- Homework

### Medellín
- Selina
- Tinkko
- WeWork
- Atomhouse

### Buenos Aires
- WeWork
- Urban Station
- La Maquinita

**Tip**: Many cafes have decent WiFi, but don't count on it for important calls.

## Mobile Data as Backup

### Mexico
- Telcel: Best coverage
- AT&T: Good in cities
- ~$20/month for 10GB

### Colombia
- Claro: Best coverage
- Tigo: Good value
- ~$15/month for 10GB

### Brazil
- Vivo: Best coverage
- Claro: Good alternative
- ~$20/month for 10GB

**Pro tip**: Get a local SIM immediately. Mobile hotspot saves the day when WiFi fails.

## Hardware to Bring

### Essential

**Travel router**: TP-Link or GL.iNet
- Creates your own network from hotel/Airbnb WiFi
- Connects multiple devices
- More secure than public networks

**Long ethernet cable**: 25-50 feet
- Often faster than WiFi
- More stable for calls
- Many places have ethernet jacks

### Recommended

**Portable hotspot device**: Skyroam or similar
- Works across countries
- Day pass model
- True emergency backup

**USB WiFi adapter**: Backup if laptop WiFi fails

## Video Call Survival Tips

### Before Important Calls

1. Test connection 30 minutes before
2. Close unnecessary tabs/apps
3. Have mobile hotspot ready
4. Know the "call me back" plan
5. Position near router

### During Calls

1. Turn off video if audio is choppy
2. Use ethernet if possible
3. Disable HD video if struggling
4. Have chat backup for key points
5. Don't be afraid to reschedule

### Platform Tips

- **Zoom**: Most bandwidth-efficient
- **Google Meet**: Good compression
- **Teams**: Heavier, needs more bandwidth
- **Slack huddles**: Light, good for quick calls

## Choosing Accommodation for Internet

### Red Flags

- No speed test provided
- "WiFi included" with no details
- Shared connection with many units
- Rural location without fiber
- Host doesn't respond to internet questions

### Green Flags

- Speed test screenshot provided
- Dedicated fiber connection
- Backup mobile hotspot available
- Recent reviews mentioning good WiFi
- Host works remotely themselves

### Questions to Ask

1. "Can you send a speed test from this morning?"
2. "Is this a dedicated connection or shared?"
3. "How often does internet go out?"
4. "Is there fiber to the building?"
5. "What's the backup if WiFi fails?"

## The $50 Test Stay

Before committing to monthly rent:

1. Book 2-3 nights on Airbnb
2. Work a full day from the space
3. Take video calls
4. Test at different times
5. Then negotiate monthly rate

Worth the extra cost to avoid a month of bad internet.

## My Setup

What I travel with:

- **Primary**: Apartment fiber (verify before booking)
- **Backup 1**: Mobile hotspot (local SIM with data)
- **Backup 2**: Coworking membership
- **Hardware**: Travel router, ethernet cable, USB adapter
- **Scheduling**: Important calls when I know connection is best

I've never missed a call due to internet, but I've come close. Always have a backup.

## Bottom Line

Internet in Latin America is generally fine for remote work—in the right places, with the right verification.

The keys:
1. **Verify** before committing (speed tests, reviews)
2. **Location** matters enormously (building to building)
3. **Backup** plans are essential (mobile hotspot minimum)
4. **Test** before signing anything long-term

Don't let bad internet ruin your LATAM experience. Do your homework, and you'll be fine.
