Let me save you months of apartment hunting frustration. After living in Mexico City on and off for years, I've seen every neighborhood the expat crowd talks about — and some they don't. Here's the real breakdown.

## Roma Norte: The Default Choice

Everyone lands here. There's a reason for that, and there's also a reason some people leave after six months.

**The Good:** Roma Norte is genuinely walkable. Tree-lined streets, excellent coffee shops on every corner, restaurants ranging from $3 tacos to $80 tasting menus. The architecture is beautiful — lots of Art Deco and Art Nouveau buildings that survived the '85 earthquake. You can walk to most things you need. The vibe is young, creative, international.

**The Bad:** It's become an expat bubble. On some blocks, you'll hear more English than Spanish. Rents have skyrocketed — a decent one-bedroom that was $800/month in 2020 is now $1,400-1,800. The landlords know they can charge premium prices to remote workers. Also, the party scene can get old. Thursday through Sunday, the streets are packed with people bar-hopping until 4am.

**What you'll pay:** $1,200-2,000/month for a furnished one-bedroom. Studios exist for $900-1,200 if you hunt.

**My take:** Great for your first 3-6 months. You'll make friends easily. But once the novelty wears off, you might crave something more... Mexican.

## Condesa: Roma's Fancier Sibling

Just west of Roma, Condesa is leafier, slightly more upscale, and revolves around two beautiful parks — Parque México and Parque España.

**The Good:** Dog paradise. Everyone walks their dogs through the parks. The café culture is strong. You can run or walk for miles on pleasant sidewalks. Slightly less chaotic than Roma, but still close to everything. Great brunch scene.

**The Bad:** Even more expensive than Roma. Very residential — not as much nightlife, which is good or bad depending on your vibe. Some streets flood badly during rainy season (July-September). The expat concentration is just as high.

**What you'll pay:** $1,400-2,500/month for a one-bedroom. Some luxury apartments push $3,500+.

**My take:** If you're over 30, not into clubbing every weekend, and have the budget, Condesa is more livable long-term than Roma.

## Polanco: Money Talks

This is where wealthy Mexicans live. Think: Mexico City's Upper East Side.

**The Good:** Safe as it gets in CDMX. Beautiful wide boulevards. Best restaurants in the city (Pujol, Quintonil). High-end shopping. Museums including the incredible Soloaga Anthropology Museum. International schools if you have kids.

**The Bad:** Expensive as hell. You'll need a car or Uber everywhere — it's not as walkable as Roma/Condesa. The vibe is corporate and older. You might be the only gringo on your block, but you'll also have less authentic cultural immersion. It feels like it could be Miami.

**What you'll pay:** $2,500-4,500/month for a nice apartment. Penthouses go much higher.

**My take:** If you're running a company, doing business in Mexico, or just want maximum comfort with minimal friction, Polanco delivers. Not for the "I want an authentic experience" crowd.

## Coyoacán: The Artist's Choice

South of the center, Coyoacán is where Frida Kahlo lived. It's got a completely different vibe — more like a colonial town that happens to be inside a mega-city.

**The Good:** Genuinely charming central plaza with street vendors, ice cream, couples on dates. The Frida Kahlo museum is here. More Mexican families, fewer laptops in cafés. Cheaper than Roma/Condesa. The food market is outstanding.

**The Bad:** Getting to/from the "expat zone" in Roma/Condesa takes 30-45 minutes minimum. Limited nightlife. Some areas are sketchier than others. Fewer English speakers, which is good for your Spanish but challenging at first.

**What you'll pay:** $800-1,400/month for a one-bedroom. Much better value than northern neighborhoods.

**My take:** Perfect if you're staying 6+ months, want to actually learn Spanish, and don't need to be in the thick of expat social life. Writers, artists, and introverts love it here.

## Juárez: The Underrated Middle Ground

Sandwiched between Roma and the Centro Histórico, Juárez is having a moment.

**The Good:** More affordable than Roma while being walking distance to it. Best LGBTQ+ scene in the city (Zona Rosa is technically in Juárez). Some excellent bars and restaurants popping up. Historic buildings being converted to cool apartments.

**The Bad:** Rougher around the edges. Some blocks are great, others feel sketchy. More street noise. The Zona Rosa part gets touristy and can feel seedy.

**What you'll pay:** $900-1,500/month for a one-bedroom.

**My take:** Good value if you pick your block carefully. Walk it before you sign anything.

## Narvarte: The Up-and-Comer

South of Roma, Narvarte is where locals who got priced out of Condesa are moving.

**The Good:** Real neighborhood feel. Mexican families, corner stores, local taquerias. Much cheaper rent. Still safe. Good metro access.

**The Bad:** Less "curated" — you won't find as many Instagram-worthy coffee shops. Fewer expats, which means potentially less social life if that's your thing.

**What you'll pay:** $700-1,200/month for a one-bedroom.

**My take:** Best value in the city right now. If you speak some Spanish and want to stretch your budget, Narvarte is the move.

## Santa Fe: Corporate Wasteland

The business district. All glass towers and shopping malls.

**My take:** No. Unless your office is literally there and you have no choice. There's nothing walkable, no character, no reason to live here.

## Centro Histórico: Beautiful But...

The colonial heart of the city. Stunning architecture, the Zócalo, incredible history.

**My take:** Better for visiting than living. Air quality is worse, street crime is higher, and it gets overwhelming. Some people make it work in the right building, but there are easier options.

|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|------|
| Roma Norte | $1,200-2,000 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Very High | Young, party, international |

## My Recommendation

**First-timers:** Start in Roma Norte for 2-3 months. Meet people, learn the city, figure out what matters to you.

**Budget-conscious:** Narvarte or Coyoacán. Your money goes twice as far.

**Families or professionals:** Condesa or Polanco.

**Long-term residents:** Explore beyond the gringo bubble. Coyoacán, Narvarte, even neighborhoods like Del Valle or San Rafael offer a more authentic experience at half the price.

The most important thing? Walk a neighborhood at different times of day before signing a lease. What feels charming at 2pm might feel sketchy at 11pm, or vice versa. And don't sign anything longer than 6 months until you're sure.
