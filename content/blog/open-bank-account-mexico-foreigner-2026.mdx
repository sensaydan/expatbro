# How to Open a Bank Account in Mexico as a Foreigner (2026)

Having a local bank account in Mexico makes life significantly easier—paying rent, receiving pesos, avoiding ATM fees. But the process isn't always straightforward for foreigners.

Here's exactly how to do it.

## Can Foreigners Open Bank Accounts in Mexico?

Yes, but with caveats:

- **Tourist visa**: Very difficult, most banks refuse
- **Temporary residency**: Yes, most banks accept
- **Permanent residency**: Yes, no issues
- **Work visa**: Yes, straightforward

The key document is your **visa type**. Without at least temporary residency, your options are limited.

## Best Banks for Foreigners

### Tier 1: Foreigner-Friendly

**BBVA México (Bancomer)**
- Most expat-friendly major bank
- English support available
- Good mobile app
- Sometimes accepts tourists (branch dependent)
- Opening time: 1-2 hours

**Santander México**
- Second most foreigner-friendly
- Decent app
- Usually requires residency
- Opening time: 1-2 hours

### Tier 2: Will Work With Residency

**Banorte**
- Mexican bank, less English support
- Good rates, solid app
- Requires residency
- More paperwork than BBVA

**HSBC México**
- International bank, should be easy
- Reality: Often stricter than local banks
- Hit or miss by branch

**Citibanamex**
- Large network
- Bureaucratic process
- Not the best app
- Requires residency

### Tier 3: Avoid for Foreigners

**Banco Azteca**: Limited services, not worth it
**BanCoppel**: Same issues
**Smaller banks**: More hassle, less benefit

## Documents You'll Need

### Essential (Everyone)

1. **Passport**: Original + copy
2. **Mexican visa**: Original + copy (FM2/FM3 or residency card)
3. **Proof of address**: Utility bill, bank statement, or rental contract (must be recent, in your name)
4. **RFC** (Tax ID): Some banks require, some don't
5. **CURP**: Sometimes requested (foreigner CURP)

### If You Have Residency

Your residency card usually serves as both ID and proof of legal status. This simplifies things significantly.

### The Proof of Address Problem

This is where most foreigners get stuck:

- You need a bank account to pay utilities
- You need utilities in your name for a bank account
- Classic chicken-and-egg

**Solutions:**

1. **Rental contract**: Most banks accept this
2. **Affidavit of address**: Notarized letter from your landlord
3. **Bank statement from home country**: Some branches accept international statements
4. **Phone bill**: Get a Telcel postpaid plan (easier to get)

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Gather Documents

Before visiting any bank:
- Make copies of everything
- Have proof of address sorted
- Know your Mexican address by heart (for forms)

### Step 2: Choose Your Branch

Not all branches are equal for foreigners:
- **Roma/Condesa/Polanco branches**: More experience with expats
- **Avoid small neighborhood branches**: Less flexible
- **Go weekday mornings**: Shorter lines, fresher staff

### Step 3: Visit the Bank

What to expect:
- Take a number and wait (30-60 minutes typical)
- Explain you want to open a "cuenta de débito" (debit account)
- They'll review your documents
- If approved, you'll fill out forms

### Step 4: The Interview

Banks may ask:
- Purpose of the account
- Expected monthly deposits
- Source of income
- Length of stay in Mexico

Be honest but simple. "Remote worker, receive salary, pay rent" is sufficient.

### Step 5: Receive Your Card

If approved:
- Temporary card issued immediately (some banks)
- Permanent card mailed in 1-2 weeks
- Activate via app or ATM
- Set up mobile banking

## Opening Without Residency

It's harder but possible:

### BBVA - Your Best Bet

Some BBVA branches will open accounts for tourists:
- Requires significant initial deposit ($5,000+ MXN)
- May need proof of income
- Branch manager discretion
- Try Polanco or Roma locations

### Hey Banco (Digital)

- 100% digital bank
- Has accepted tourists in the past
- Requirements change frequently
- Worth trying as backup

### Rappi Card

- Not a bank account, but a prepaid card
- Works with just passport
- Can receive transfers
- Limited features but functional

## The RFC Question

RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes) is Mexico's tax ID.

**Required by**: Some banks for account opening
**Not required by**: BBVA (usually), Santander (sometimes)

### Getting an RFC as a Foreigner

If you have residency:
1. Visit SAT (tax office) with residency card
2. Fill out forms
3. Get RFC immediately
4. Free process

Without residency, you can't get an RFC—another reason residency matters.

## Alternative Solutions

If you can't open a Mexican bank account:

### Wise (TransferWise)

- Get USD, EUR, MXN balances
- Mexican bank details for receiving pesos
- Excellent exchange rates
- Works with just passport

**Limitation**: Can't deposit cash, limited ATM withdrawals

### Payoneer

- Similar to Wise
- Multiple currency accounts
- Can receive client payments
- Good for freelancers

### N26 / Revolut

- European digital banks
- Multi-currency
- Work in Mexico (with limitations)
- ATM withdrawals available

### Keep Your Home Bank

- Use Schwab (no ATM fees worldwide)
- Or other no-FTF debit card
- Convert at ATMs as needed
- Not ideal but works

## Monthly Account Costs

Mexican banks often charge monthly fees:

| Bank | Account Type | Monthly Fee |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| BBVA | Cuenta Fácil | $0 (conditions apply) |
| BBVA | Libretón | ~$50 MXN |
| Santander | Súper Cuenta | ~$100 MXN |
| Banorte | Enlace | ~$70 MXN |

**Avoiding fees:**
- Maintain minimum balance
- Receive regular deposits
- Use direct deposit for rent/income

## What You Can Do With a Mexican Account

Once you have an account:

- **Pay rent**: Direct transfer (SPEI)
- **Pay utilities**: Auto-debit
- **Receive pesos**: From clients or transfers
- **ATM withdrawals**: Free at your bank's ATMs
- **CoDi payments**: Mexico's QR payment system
- **Build credit history**: For future reference

## Common Problems and Solutions

### "We don't open accounts for tourists"

**Response**: "I understand. Is there a branch that does, or a specific account type for visitors?"

Sometimes they'll call another branch or find a solution.

### "You need an RFC"

**Response**: "Can I open an account without RFC? I'm happy to provide additional documentation."

BBVA specifically has accounts that don't require RFC.

### "Your proof of address isn't valid"

**Response**: Bring multiple options. Rental contract + notarized letter is usually enough.

### Rejected for Unknown Reason

Try:
- Different branch
- Different bank
- Come back with more documentation
- Bring a Mexican friend for translation

## Recommended Strategy

### Short-term Stay (1-6 months)
- Use Wise for peso transactions
- Keep home bank for ATM
- Don't stress about local account

### Medium-term (6-12 months)
- Get temporary residency
- Open BBVA account
- Use for rent and bills

### Long-term (1+ year)
- Permanent residency
- Full banking relationship
- Consider investing locally

## Final Tips

1. **Be patient**: Mexican bureaucracy moves slowly
2. **Dress nicely**: Shouldn't matter, but it helps
3. **Go early**: Banks are emptier 9-10am
4. **Speak Spanish**: Even basic Spanish helps significantly
5. **Bring everything**: Over-prepare on documents

Getting a Mexican bank account isn't always easy, but it's worth the effort. The convenience of local banking, avoiding fees, and integrating into the financial system pays off quickly.
