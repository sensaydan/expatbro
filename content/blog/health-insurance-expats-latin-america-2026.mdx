# Health Insurance for Expats in Latin America (2026 Guide)

Healthcare in Latin America is surprisingly good—and surprisingly affordable compared to the US. But navigating insurance options as an expat can be confusing.

Here's everything you need to know.

## Your Four Options

### Option 1: International Health Insurance

Traditional expat health insurance. Companies like:

- **Cigna Global**
- **Allianz Worldwide**
- **Aetna International**
- **IMG Global**

**Pros:**
- Works in multiple countries
- Covers evacuation
- Can include US coverage
- Established claims process

**Cons:**
- Expensive ($200-600/month)
- Often unnecessary in LATAM
- May not cover pre-existing conditions
- Annual increases

**Best for:** Frequent travelers, those who need US coverage, high-risk situations

### Option 2: Digital Nomad Insurance

Designed for remote workers. Options:

- **SafetyWing** (~$45/month)
- **World Nomads** (trip-based)
- **Genki** (~$35/month)
- **PassportCard Nomads**

**Pros:**
- Affordable
- Flexible (month-to-month)
- Covers multiple countries
- Easy signup

**Cons:**
- Lower coverage limits
- May not cover chronic conditions
- Not always accepted by hospitals
- Read the fine print on exclusions

**Best for:** Short-term nomads, young and healthy people, budget-conscious

### Option 3: Local Insurance

Buy insurance in your country of residence:

- **IMSS** (Mexico - public, through employer)
- **ISSSTE** (Mexico - government workers)
- **Private plans** (GNP, AXA, Mapfre, etc.)

**Pros:**
- Often cheapest option
- Covers local hospitals directly
- No international claims hassle
- Can be comprehensive

**Cons:**
- Only works in that country
- May require residency
- Language barriers in claims
- Coverage varies widely

**Best for:** Long-term residents, those with legal residency

### Option 4: Pay As You Go (Self-Insure)

No insurance. Pay out of pocket.

**Pros:**
- No monthly premiums
- Healthcare is cheap in LATAM
- Works for minor issues
- Maximum flexibility

**Cons:**
- Catastrophic risk exposure
- No negotiated rates
- Requires cash reserves
- Stressful for serious issues

**Best for:** Healthy people with savings, those comfortable with risk

## The Real Cost of Healthcare in Latin America

Before deciding, understand what you're insuring against:

### Mexico (Private Hospitals)

| Service | Cost (USD) |
|---------|------------|
| Doctor visit | $30-80 |
| Specialist visit | $50-150 |
| ER visit | $100-300 |
| X-ray | $30-100 |
| MRI | $200-500 |
| Surgery (minor) | $1,000-5,000 |
| Surgery (major) | $5,000-30,000 |
| Hospital night | $200-600 |

### Colombia

Generally 20-30% cheaper than Mexico for equivalent care.

### Brazil

Closer to US prices in major cities, but still 50-70% cheaper.

## My Recommendation By Situation

### Young, Healthy, Nomadic (Under 35)

**Choice**: SafetyWing or Genki

- ~$45/month
- Covers emergencies and hospitals
- Won't break the bank
- Keep $5,000 in emergency fund for deductibles/exclusions

### Established Expat (With Residency)

**Choice**: Local private insurance + catastrophic international

- Local plan: $100-200/month
- Add SafetyWing for travel/evacuation
- Best of both worlds

### Over 40 or Health Conditions

**Choice**: Proper international insurance

- Cigna, Allianz, or similar
- Higher cost but real coverage
- Pre-existing condition coverage if enrolled early
- Worth the premium at this stage

### Family with Kids

**Choice**: Comprehensive local or international

- Kids get sick constantly
- Routine care adds up
- Need reliable hospital access
- Don't cheap out here

### Retirees

**Choice**: International with evacuation + local for routine

- Medicare doesn't work abroad
- Evacuation coverage is crucial
- Local plan for regular care
- Budget $300-500/month total

## Country-Specific Notes

### Mexico

**Public option (IMSS)**: Available to legal residents and workers. Very cheap (~$600/year). Quality varies by location. Long waits but comprehensive.

**Popular private insurers**: GNP, AXA, Seguros Monterrey

**Best private hospitals**: 
- CDMX: ABC, Médica Sur, Hospital Ángeles
- Guadalajara: Hospital San Javier
- Monterrey: Christus Muguerza

### Colombia

**EPS (Public system)**: Available with work visa or residency. Heavily subsidized. Long waits but decent care.

**Private insurers**: Sura, Colsanitas, Compensar

**Best private hospitals**:
- Bogotá: Fundación Santa Fe, Clínica del Country
- Medellín: Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Clínica Las Vegas

### Brazil

**SUS (Public system)**: Technically available to all residents. Quality varies dramatically. Best avoided if possible.

**Private plans**: Amil, Bradesco Saúde, SulAmérica

**Best private hospitals**:
- São Paulo: Hospital Albert Einstein, Sírio-Libanês
- Rio: Copa Star, Samaritano

## What to Look For in Any Plan

### Coverage Limits

- **Per incident**: At least $100,000
- **Annual maximum**: At least $500,000
- **Lifetime maximum**: $1,000,000+

Lower limits are false economy. One serious incident can bankrupt you.

### Deductibles

- Higher deductible = lower premium
- $500-2,500 deductibles make sense
- Keep deductible amount in savings
- Don't go above $5,000 unless very healthy

### Exclusions

Read carefully. Common exclusions:

- Pre-existing conditions (often excluded or waiting period)
- Mental health (limited or excluded)
- Dental (usually separate)
- Extreme sports (skydiving, etc.)
- Pregnancy (often excluded or waiting period)

### Network vs Reimbursement

- **Network**: Hospital bills insurance directly
- **Reimbursement**: You pay, then claim back

Network is easier. Reimbursement gives more hospital choice. Know which model your plan uses.

### Evacuation Coverage

If serious injury/illness requires better care:

- Evacuation to US/home country: $50,000-100,000
- Air ambulance: Even more
- Essential for remote locations
- Often included in good plans

## The Visa Requirement Question

Many visas require proof of health insurance:

- **Colombia digital nomad visa**: Yes
- **Mexico temporary residency**: Sometimes asked
- **Brazil**: Rarely enforced
- **Argentina**: Yes, for some visas

Check requirements before choosing a plan. Some need specific coverage amounts or policy language.

## How to Actually Buy

### International Plans

1. Get quotes online (multiple providers)
2. Compare coverage, not just price
3. Read reviews (InsureMyTrip, Reddit)
4. Buy direct or through broker
5. Keep policy documents accessible

### Digital Nomad Plans

1. Sign up online (takes 5 minutes)
2. Coverage starts next day or specified date
3. Keep app/card accessible
4. Know the claims process

### Local Plans

1. Research options in-country
2. Often requires in-person signup
3. May need residency or visa
4. Get help from a local if needed

## When Things Go Wrong

### Minor Issues

1. Find a good private doctor (ask expats for recommendations)
2. Pay out of pocket ($30-100)
3. Claim later if plan covers it
4. Skip insurance hassle for small stuff

### Serious Issues

1. Go to the best private hospital available
2. Contact insurance immediately (most have 24/7 lines)
3. Get pre-authorization for procedures if time allows
4. Keep all receipts and documentation
5. Follow up on claims diligently

### True Emergencies

1. Call emergency services (911 in most countries)
2. Go to nearest hospital (public or private)
3. Deal with insurance after stabilized
4. Evacuation if necessary

## Final Thoughts

The right insurance depends on:

- Your age and health
- Your risk tolerance
- Your cash reserves
- Your travel patterns
- Your length of stay

There's no one-size-fits-all answer. But doing nothing is the wrong answer.

At minimum:
- Catastrophic coverage
- Evacuation coverage
- Emergency fund

Healthcare in Latin America is good and affordable. Insurance is about protecting against the 1% scenarios that could ruin you financially.

Don't overthink it, but don't ignore it.
