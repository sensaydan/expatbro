Every YouTube video tells you Medellín is cheap. "$1,000 a month and you'll live like a king!" Sure, if your idea of royalty is a windowless apartment in a sketchy neighborhood, eating rice and beans every day, and never leaving your building.

Let me give you real numbers from someone who's actually tracked expenses there.

## The Honest Budget Breakdown

### Housing: $800-1,800/month

**The fantasy:** A $400 apartment exists.

**The reality:** That $400 apartment is in a building your mom would cry about, in a neighborhood where you'll clutch your phone walking home, with furniture from 1987.

For a **decent furnished one-bedroom in El Poblado** (where most expats live), expect:
- Basic but livable: $800-1,000
- Nice, modern, with good amenities: $1,200-1,500
- Luxury with rooftop pool and gym: $1,500-2,000+

**In Laureles** (more local, cheaper, still nice):
- Basic: $600-800
- Good: $900-1,200
- Nice: $1,200-1,400

Utilities add $50-100/month (electricity is the killer if you use AC — and you might not need it given the weather).

**Pro tip:** Airbnb monthly rates are often the same or better than "long-term" rentals you find on Properati or Facebook groups, plus you get flexible cancellation.

### Food: $400-800/month

**Eating like a local:**
- Menu del día (set lunch): $3-5 — this is your secret weapon. Soup, main course, drink, sometimes dessert. Available everywhere.
- Street food: $1-3 per item
- Grocery run: $40-60/week for basics
- Local restaurant dinner: $8-15

**Eating like an expat:**
- Brunch at a trendy café: $12-20
- Nice dinner out: $25-40
- El Poblado restaurant scene: Same prices as a mid-tier US city

I usually do a mix: menu del día for lunch (saves a fortune), cook breakfast, and splurge on dinners a few times a week. That runs me about $500-600/month.

### Transportation: $50-150/month

The metro is excellent and costs about $0.70 per ride. If you live near a station and work from home/coworking spaces, you can get by on $50/month.

But most expats end up using Uber/DiDi regularly. A 15-minute ride is $3-5. Take 2-3 of those daily and you're at $150-200/month easy.

**Don't rent a car.** Traffic is insane, parking is a nightmare, and you don't need one.

### Coworking: $100-300/month

If you work remotely, you'll probably want a coworking space. Selina, Tinkko, and Atom House are popular.

- Hot desk: $100-150/month
- Dedicated desk: $200-250/month
- Private office: $400+

Or just work from cafés and save the money. Pergamino, Urbania, and Café Velvet all have good WiFi and don't care if you camp out for hours.

### Entertainment/Social: $200-500/month

This is where it gets variable. Medellín has excellent nightlife and a huge expat social scene. If you're going out:

- Bar drinks: $3-6
- Club entry: $10-20
- Nice cocktail bar: $8-12 per drink
- Tinder/Hinge date dinner: $30-50 total

Dancing at salsa clubs is cheap (sometimes free entry). The expensive nights are at the "gringo" spots in El Poblado where everyone's trying to impress each other.

Budget $300/month if you're social. $500 if you're *very* social.

### Health Insurance: $100-200/month

You need this. Options:

- SafetyWing (popular with nomads): $50-80/month
- Local EPS (Colombian insurance): $80-150/month — covers everything locally
- International coverage (Cigna, etc.): $200-400/month

If you're staying 6+ months, get an EPS through a local broker. The quality of private healthcare in Medellín is excellent and shockingly affordable.

### Gym & Fitness: $30-80/month

Bodytech (the big chain): $50-70/month
Crossfit boxes: $80-120/month
Random local gyms: $25-40/month

### Phone/Internet: $30-50/month

Get a Claro or Movistar prepaid SIM with data. $15-20/month for plenty of data.

Home internet: $20-30/month for solid fiber.

## The Hidden Costs Nobody Mentions

**Visa runs:** If you're on tourist visas, you'll need to leave and re-enter every 90-180 days. Budget $300-500 per trip (flight, hotels, etc.).

**The gringo tax:** Landlords, some restaurants, and service providers will quote you higher prices. It's not everywhere, but it happens.

**Social pressure:** The expat scene in Medellín can get expensive. Constant invites to rooftop bars, pool parties, weekend trips. You can say no, but the FOMO is real.

**Getting set up:** First month costs include deposits (usually 1-2 months), furnishing gaps, and random stuff you need to buy. Add $500-1,000 for setup.

## The Bottom Line

Can you survive on $1,500/month in Medellín? Yes.

Will you be comfortable on $1,500/month? Barely.

Will you actually enjoy yourself and not feel like you're constantly penny-pinching? Budget $2,000-2,500/month minimum.

The people posting about their $800/month lifestyle are either lying, living in rough conditions, or were there in 2019 when things were actually that cheap. Medellín has gotten significantly more expensive in the past few years as more gringos arrived.

Still much cheaper than US cities. But not the "$1,000/month paradise" the internet promised you.
